- Choosing a Programming Language
- Getting a dictionary of a lot of words
- Using that to build a dictionary where it lists how many times a word appears
- "the" would appear more number of times than "avengers"
- checking if our word appears in that dictionary or not and giving it a P(c)
- finding all the words which look like our word by deletion, transposition, replacing or inserting letters
- Giving the above give words a P(c) with help of the dictionary made above
- Do above 2 steps once more with the words found above
- Also give those above words a P(w/c) which basically tells you how much different is given word with the original word

- For now hit it off in python
- But this will be a lot better in a compiled language and using an sql database for the dictionary of words
