## Programming Language Translator

- The Concepts of Programming Language Translator can also be applied to natural language translator
- but nlt is way more complicated because in plt you can define which a syntax or the way input is given, you can't do it in nlt.

- In plt if the syntax is wrong or translator can't understand the input, it can show an error
- In nlt, we can simply ignore that line
- But we also need to know the whole context in which the input/paragraph was given
- So It's  a good idea to make nlt act like an interpreter with some back memory mechanism
