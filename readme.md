# Time - A natural language UI

### Brain
- Text to Text using processes based system
- Make simple processes like file manager, music player
- Checking for status/posts
- Try to implement everything a GUI/OS does

### Text To Speech
- Record every word in English language
- Get a text, search in above database and play it
- Learn about Natural Language Processing and implement it here
- Make logic for searching for sentences

### Speech To Text
- Record every word in different styles
- On recording, check for the sound which has high volume
- Get the audio snippet from the above recording
- Search for it in the database
- Use English grammar/ Natural Language Processing to optimize the search
- Make a Feedback system where if the conversion is wrong, it corrects itself for later times

### Artificial Intelligence
- Research needed

### GUI
- Make a smart GUI with above concept
- This will also mean making your own OS (maybe on top of linux kernel)
